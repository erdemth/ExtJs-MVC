# ExtJs-Mvc-Framework

Based on the traditional 3-tier architecture, we use NHibernate, API Controller and ExtJs to build a standard single page web application(SPA) framework, and serve for enterprises and government applications.

In the DAL-tier, we use NHibernate 4.0. NHibernate is a mature, open source object-relational mapper for the .NET framework. It's actively developed, fully featured and used in thousands of successful projects. As a result of using Code First, you just need to design the entity class, and the NHibernate will automaticly generate the tables for you. It is really amazing!
  
In the BLL-tier, in addition to the business logic, we provide API controller to serve the Web-tier. If you have the needs of mobile apps, you need not to code for the mobile app interface.
  
In the Web-tier, we use the latest ExtJs6.0. It provides the design pattern of Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM), and can load javascripts dynamically. No matter how big your web application is, the application is really fast and provides a friendly user experience.
